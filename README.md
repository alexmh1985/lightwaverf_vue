# using lightwaverf's API in a bootstrap vue application

api.php does all of the communication with lightwave's api, it should discover your devices, list them and allow you to control them. 
This app is pretty basic but it allows you to do turn lights and switches on/off and control dim levels. It would make a good raspberry pi project / home automation.
